# CMOS

CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology is the backbone of modern VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) circuits.  
It is widely used in **logic design, processors, memories, and SoCs** due to its **low power consumption, scalability, and high performance**.

Key features:
- Uses **both NMOS and PMOS transistors** in a complementary fashion.
- Power dissipation is mainly **dynamic** (during switching).
- Used in digital, analog, and mixed-signal designs.

# CMOS Basics

## Structure
- **NMOS**: Turns ON when gate voltage > threshold (Vth).
- **PMOS**: Turns ON when gate voltage < threshold (Vth).
- Together, they form **logic gates** (like inverter, NAND, NOR).

## Advantages of CMOS
1. **Low Power Consumption** → Only during switching, static power is minimal.
2. **High Noise Immunity** → Robust against voltage fluctuations.
3. **Scalability** → Compatible with deep sub-micron and nanometer technologies.
4. **High Packing Density** → Billions of transistors can fit on a single chip.

## Disadvantages
- Performance reduces at very small geometries due to short-channel effects.
- Leakage currents increase in deep nanometer nodes.

# CMOS Design Flow

A typical CMOS design in Cadence follows these steps:

1. **Specification**
   - Define circuit functionality (e.g., inverter, amplifier, full adder).

2. **Schematic Design**
   - Draw transistor-level circuits using NMOS and PMOS.
   - Assign correct W/L ratios for performance.

3. **Testbench Creation**
   - Apply input signals (pulse, sinusoidal, DC) and connect power supplies.
   - Define simulation parameters.

4. **Simulation**
   - Run DC, AC, and Transient analysis using Spectre.
   - Check for voltage transfer characteristics (VTC), delay, and power.

5. **Layout Design**
   - Convert schematic to physical layout.
   - Ensure proper design rules (DRC).

6. **Verification**
   - **DRC (Design Rule Check)** → Check layout vs. foundry rules.
   - **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)** → Ensure layout matches schematic.
   - **PEX (Parasitic Extraction)** → Extract parasitics for accurate simulation.

7. **Fabrication Ready**
   - Generate GDSII file for chip manufacturing.

Do you also want me to **prepare a sample "schematic\_description.md" with detailed explanation + equations (like VTC, Noise Margin, Power formulas)** so it looks even more professional?
